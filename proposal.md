The education resources include the course resource, the library resource, the professor resource can be regarded as critical resources for students. In order to quantify the education resources and allowcate the education resources better as "Fair Education", we would like to start a new token system: "Campus Token"  
  
Nowadays some courses at TUM can only have limited students and most of them solve this problem by "FCFS" priciple, some of the lab courses and seminar courses also start a matching process in Matching system to avoid "SPAM" register. But is it the best way?   
Consider of the following scenario:   
>
    Bob chooses the seminar as his first priority because he has to take a seminar course to finish his master study, while Alice also chooses the seminar as her first priority just for interest. The priority system can not represent the real desire of the course for students. Instead, we can give 10 tokens for Alice and Bob, Bob would like to afford this course 9 tokens, and Alice may only want to give 5 tokens.  
  
So what we want to do, is to quantify the education resources. The course resource, library resource and even the meetings can have an abstract token price. At the begin of every semester, students will be distributed 100 Tokens. The is fair, because every student has the same tokens at the beginning and they can make their own choices.  
  
Students allowcate their tokens by themselves, for example: they can choose to take 10 courses of 10 tokens each, or take 2 courses of 40 tokens and borrow 5 books, or even take a meal to spend 5 Tokens, and keep the rest tokens for next semester if the student wants to take less courses this semester and more courses next semester.  
  
Professors can regulate the price of their courses to restrict the number of students and also can distribute some of the "incoming tokens" as "scholarship" to encourage students.  
  
In order to make the tokens more useful in the future, this system should be decentralized to avoid anyone to change the token data.   
  
# Scale the problem  
  
For this seminar, we want to restrict the scale of the problem, so we only want to implement two systems besides the basic token system:  
  
Library system: students can borrow books using their tokens.  
  
Course system: Professor(or some students) can release their courses with a token price, if students choose the course, the tokens will be consumed.
