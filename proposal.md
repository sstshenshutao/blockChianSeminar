
# Background  
Every year the city officials remove thousands of padlocks...
the weight of locks may cause danger to the whole bridge.
The lock was supposed to be "forever", but after the removal we can't find it anymore, so does the "love"..
There are many fancy stories inside a love, you may want to share it with others....

# BLOCKCHAIN LOVE LOCK
Real Permanent: the lock can never be removed by the city or other guys.
Forever love diary: memory is treasure.

# Scale the problem  

For this seminar, we want to restrict the scale of the problem, so we only want to implement following systems:

1. publish Diary
2. publish Lock
3. front-end: present them in a web(bridge with locks, press can see the diaries)
------ until Tuesday
4. function: modify the diary. seperate the lock(erc721) and diary(block storage)
5. different kinds of locks(erc721)
6. front-end: different pictures
------ later
7. different place of bridge. different bridge(location-based)
8. front-end: different pictures x/y, a Map(or different location options);
